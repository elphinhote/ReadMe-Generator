<h1> Task <h1>

My task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Review the Good README Guide as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

The application is invoked by using the following command:
node index.js

The link to a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality,  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65749636/107005975-55833a80-6745-11eb-98d9-89d95b1a60cc.mp4
Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
